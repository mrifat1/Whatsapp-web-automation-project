This is an whatsapp web automation project using python , selenium. I have used Chrome as my testing browser.
The steps are:
1.  Go to whatsapp web using driver module from selenium
2. Scan QR code manually
3. Read the phone number from excel(used "pandas" library of python to read and write from excel)
4. Search number on whatsapp 
5. Write message to that specific number
6. Send message to that number 
7. Write ""sent"" in excel for successful message sent
8. Then automated the logout option . Whatsapp will logout automatically.

For these automations, I have used xpath for every options of whatsapp.
